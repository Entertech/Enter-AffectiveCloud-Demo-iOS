"如果您没有长期的冥想训练，则您在特定大脑状态下的脑电波会集中。 当您聚焦时，“放松”值通常较低，而当您放松时，“关注”值较低。 注意和放松是互斥的。\n\n经过长期的冥想练习，脑电波的传播范围更加广泛甚至均匀。 您可以同时获得高分的注意力和放松度，从而放松身心并集中精力。 在这种状态下，更容易获得灵感和创造力。" = "If you do not have long-term meditation training, your brainwaves in a specific brain state is concentrated. When you are focused, the Relaxation value is generally low, and when you are relaxed, the Attention value is low.
